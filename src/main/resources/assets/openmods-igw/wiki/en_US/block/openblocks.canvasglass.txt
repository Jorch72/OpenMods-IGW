[prefix{l}]Obtaining [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]Painting [prefix{}]
A special version of glass canvas can be obtained through painting a supported block with a [link{openmods-igw:item/openblocks.paintbrush}]paint brush [link{}].
The painted block will transform into a special version of the canvas, with its original texture as a background and the painted colors as an overlay.
This special version of the canvas, also, won't drop itself when broken, but it will drop the block it was obtained from, e.g. [link{block/glass}]Glass [link{}].

If the painted block is a supported solid block (e.g. [link{block/wood.oak}]Planks [link{}]), you will obtain a [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.canvas}]Canvas [link{}] instead.

[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
The Glass Canvas cannot be obtained through usual means (for more information, see the [prefix{o}]Obtaining [prefix{}]section).
When obtained through the use of commands or inventory editing, it renders as a [link{block/glass}]Glass Block [link{}].
When placed in the world through commands, external tools or right-clicking with the previously obtained item, it renders as a simple canvas.
Its behavior is pretty much the same as the normal canvas: the only way to distinguish a Glass Canvas from a Canvas, when directly placed, is by breaking them.
In fact, the Glass Canvas makes the sound of breaking glass when mined, whereas the canvas just makes the default stone sound.

[prefix{2}]Painting [prefix{}]
You can paint directly on the Glass Canvas with the use of a [link{openmods-igw:item/openblocks.paintbrush}]paint brush [link{}].
You can also paint by placing [link{openmods-igw:item/openblocks.stencil}]Stencils [link{}] and then right clicking the canvas spots with the paint brush, drawing the pattern on the canvas.

The blocks currently (1.5.1) natively supported are:

- [prefix{n}]Decoration Blocks [prefix{}] (Extra Utilities)
- [prefix{n}]Decoration Bricks [prefix{}] (Tinkers' Construct)
- [prefix{n}]Dirt [prefix{}] (Minecraft)

- [prefix{n}]Gold Block [prefix{}] (Minecraft)
- [prefix{n}]Green Screen [prefix{}] (Extra Utilities)
- [prefix{n}]Iron Block [prefix{}] (Minecraft)
- [prefix{n}]Lapis Lazuli Block [prefix{}] (Minecraft)
- [prefix{n}]Mossy Cobblestone [prefix{}] (Minecraft)
- [prefix{n}]Quartz Block [prefix{}] (Minecraft)
- [prefix{n}]Sandstone [prefix{}] (Minecraft)
- [prefix{n}]Stone [prefix{}] (Minecraft)
- [prefix{n}]Stone Bricks [prefix{}] (Minecraft)
- [prefix{n}]Wood Log [prefix{}] (Minecraft)
- [prefix{n}]Wooden Planks [prefix{}] (Biomes O' Plenty)
- [prefix{n}]Wooden Planks [prefix{}] (Minecraft)

If the Glass Canvas is obtained through painting one of the above blocks, then the transparency will be kept.
Otherwise, the Glass Canvas will always render as a Canvas.

[prefix{2}]Cleaning [prefix{}]
Using a [link{openmods-igw:item/openblocks.squeegee}]Squeegee [link{}] you can clean the canvas from paint.
Special canvases cleaned by paint will turn back to the original block.

[prefix{l}]Trivia [prefix{}]
- Originally, every Glass Canvas pixel was going to be paintable with a different colour. The idea has then been scrapped.
- When a block is replaced by the Glass Canvas, it will acquire all Glass Canvas properties, so it will become non-flammable, its blast resistance and hardness will become 1.0...
