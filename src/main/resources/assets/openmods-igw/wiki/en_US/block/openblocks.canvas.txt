[prefix{2}]Painting [prefix{}]
A special version of canvas can be obtained through painting a supported block with a [link{openmods-igw:item/openblocks.paintbrush}]paint brush [link{}].
The painted block will transform into a special version of the canvas, with its original texture as a background and the painted colors as an overlay.
This special version of the canvas, also, won't drop itself when broken, but it will drop the block it was obtained from, e.g. [link{block/wood.oak}]Planks [link{}].

If the painted block is a supported transparent block (e.g. [link{block/glass}]Glass [link{}]), you will obtain a [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.canvasglass}]Glass Canvas [link{}] instead.

[prefix{2}]Painting [prefix{}]

[prefix{l}]Trivia [prefix{}]
- Canvas blocks should be used for minimal builds: massive scale ones have been known to cause server disconnection.
- Originally, every Canvas pixel was going to be paintable with a different colour. The idea has then been scrapped.
- When a block is replaced by the Canvas, it will acquire all Canvas properties, so it will become non-flammable, its blast resistance and hardness will become 1.0...
