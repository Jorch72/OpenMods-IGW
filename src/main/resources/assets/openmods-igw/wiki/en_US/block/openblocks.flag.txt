[prefix{2}]Spontaneous drop [prefix{}]
The Flag will also spontaneously drop itself if water or lava flows into its space or a piston tries to push or moves a block into its space.
Be wary, though, that lava destroys the drop instantaneously.

[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
The Flag can be used as a decorative block for various structures or to mark pathways.

[prefix{2}]Placement [prefix{}]
To place the Flag, use the "Use Item/Place Block" control (right-click, by default) while aiming at the block you want to place the fan on.
If the block's clicked side is the top one, then the Flag will be placed on top facing west and will be rotatable.
If the block's clicked side is any other side, then the Flag will be attached to that side and will hang from the "wall", without being able to be rotated.

[prefix{2}]Rotation setting [prefix{}]
The Flag can be rotated only when it is in its standing position.
To rotate, use the "Use Item/Place Block" control on the Flag's pole.
The flag will rotate of about 10 degrees clockwise each time.

[prefix{2}]Dying [prefix{}]
The flag must be in its item form to be dyed.
While holding the flag item in the main hand, use the item while crouching (shift-right-click, by default).
This will cycle the flag through all the various available colors.
The change of color is depicted with a change in the color of the flag item.
The available colors cycle as follows:
[prefix{o}]Green, Blue, Dark Red, Light Orange, Light Brown, Lime, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Orange, Red, Lilac, Light Gray, Purple, Black, White [prefix{}]

When the dyed flag is placed and then broken again, the color resets itself to green.
It is currently unknown if this is intended or is a bug.

[prefix{l}]GUI [prefix{}]
This block has no GUI.

[prefix{l}]Setup [prefix{}]
After obtaining the flag item, shift-right-click as many times as needed to reach the desired colour.
