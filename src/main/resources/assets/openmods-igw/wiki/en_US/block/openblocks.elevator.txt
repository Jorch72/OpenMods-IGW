[prefix{l}][prefix{1}]ELEVATOR [prefix{}] [prefix{}]

"[prefix{o}]Colorable elevator blocks to quickly travel between floors. [prefix{}]"
- The feature mentioned in the README on OpenBlocks's GitHub page.

Elevators allow the player to move up or down various floors of a building in a quicker and easier way.
Elevators can only interface with ones colored with the same [link{item/dyePowder.black}]dye [link{}].

[prefix{l}]Info-Book description [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]
Place one elevator directly three or more blocks above another with no blocks  in between and you'll be able to either 'jump' to move up, or 'crouch' to move down.
Elevators can be dyed by clicking on them with [link{item/dyePowder.black}]dye [link{}], however, you can only teleport between elevators of the same color.

[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
The Elevator can be used as an alternative and quicker way of travel between various floors of a building.

[prefix{2}]Elevating players [prefix{}]
In order to teleport players between floors, the two elevator blocks must be vertically on top of each other and have no "forbidden" blocks in between.
They also have to be of the same color, otherwise the research will fail.

Once all the initial conditions are met, the player can move up and down the various elevators by jumping or crouching, respectively, while on an elevator block.
The player will instantly be teleported to the upper or lower level of elevators.
If enabled in the configuration file, this will cost the player a certain amount of experience points, according to the distance of the two elevator blocks.
The destination elevator will also play a "teleportation sound".

The player can avoid teleportation while jumping or sneaking by starting the jump or crouch action before stepping on the elevator block.
In this case the elevator will act as a normal block.

When multiple elevator blocks are used in conjuction (such as in a 2x2 square pattern), the elevator can try to center the player in the middle of the shape.
This behaviour is configurable and disabled by default.

[prefix{2}]Dying [prefix{}]
Elevator blocks can be dyed in order to distinguish them from other elevator blocks above or below.
To dye an Elevator block, right-click it with a [link{item/dyePowder.black}]dye (e.g. an ink sack) [link{}].
The Elevator block will be dyed, but the dye will not be consumed in the process.

When the elevator block is broken, the given item will have the same block color.
When placed back, the elevator loses the previous colors, though.
It is currently unknown whether this is a feature or a bug.

[prefix{2}]Crafting [prefix{}]
The Elevator can be used to craft the [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.elevator_rotating}]Rotating Elevator [link{}].

[prefix{l}]GUI [prefix{}]
This block has no GUI.

[prefix{l}]Setup [prefix{}]
Place down at least a pair of elevator blocks within the maximum distance (configurable).
Make sure there is room for a player to fit in in both spots.
If needed, dye the pair of elevators.
Then simply either jump or sneak to go up or down, according to your desire.

[prefix{l}]Configuration options [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]"blocks" category [prefix{}]
[prefix{5}]B:elevator [prefix{}]
Allows to enable (true) or disable (false) the Elevator.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] true
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@block@elevator}]

[prefix{2}]"dropblock" category [prefix{}]
[prefix{5}]B:centerOnBlock [prefix{}]
Specifies if the player should be centered (true) or not (false) when teleported between elevators.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] false
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorCenter}]
[prefix{5}]D:elevatorXpDrainRatio [prefix{}]
Specifies the ratio of XP that is consumed everytime an elevator is used.
The formula used to calculate the total XP consumed is [prefix{o}]total = distance * ratio [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] 0.0
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorXpDrainRatio}]
[prefix{5}]B:ignoreAllBlocks [prefix{}]
If enabled (true), the elevator doesn't search for blocks in-between the starting point and the ending one.
Setting this value to true is the same as using a positive infinity value for [prefix{o}]maxPassThrough [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] false
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorIgnoreBlocks}]
[prefix{5}]B:ignoreHalfBlocks [prefix{}]
If enabled (true), the elevator won't consider half blocks (e.g. [link{block/stoneSlab.stone}]Slabs [link{}]) when counting the amount of blocks it can pass through.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] false
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorIgnoreHalfBlocks}]
[prefix{5}]B:irregularBlocksArePassable [prefix{}]
If enabled (true), the elevator will attempt to pass through blocks which have custom collision boxes, or, in other words, are not a full block.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] true
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@irregularBlocksArePassable}]
[prefix{5}]I:maxPassThrough [prefix{}]
Specifies the amount of blocks the elevator can pass through before the teleportation fails.
The value is considered as the maximum bound and, as such, excluded from the check.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] 4
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorMaxBlockPassCount}]
[prefix{5}]I:searchDistance [prefix{}]
Specifies the maximum distance there can be between two elevator blocks before the teleportation fails.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] 20
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorTravelDistance}]
[prefix{5}]S:specialBlockRules [prefix{}]
Specifies custom rules for specific blocks which have to be respected by elevators.
The rules must be written in the format [prefix{o}]<modId>:<blockName>:<action> [prefix{}] or [prefix{o}]id:<blockId>:<action> [prefix{}]
The valid actions are [prefix{o}]abort [prefix{}](the elevator will abort the teleportation process), [prefix{o}]increment [prefix{}](the block is counted in the limit) and [prefix{o}]ignore [prefix{}] (the block is ignored completely).
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] 
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorRules}]

[prefix{l}]History [prefix{}]

[prefix{2}]1.2.5: [prefix{}]Added a way to specify special rules for Elevator blocks to follow.
[prefix{2}]1.2.5: [prefix{}]Fixed Elevator not working when high jump boost effect levels or other jump helpers are used.
[prefix{2}]1.3.0: [prefix{}]Colored Elevators are now available in the creative inventory.
[prefix{2}]1.3.0: [prefix{}]Elevators are no more a tile entity, so they can now be moved by pistons etc.
[prefix{2}]1.3.0: [prefix{}]Fixed pick block so that it returns the correctly colored Elevator when used on dyed blocks.
[prefix{2}]1.3.0: [prefix{}]Fixed Elevator not considering actual player height.
[prefix{2}]1.4.1: [prefix{}]Added separate config option to specify the amount of blocks to ignore when teleporting between elevators.
[prefix{2}]1.4.2: [prefix{}]Elevators now do not drain XP when used by default. The behaviour can still be changed in the config file.
[prefix{2}]1.5.0: [prefix{}]Elevators doesn't change the player's coordinates after teleportation. The behaviour can be configured in the config file.

[prefix{l}]Trivia [prefix{}]
- By default, the Elevator uses a custom packet to check if the player is jumping. In case Player API is installed, the detection is reverted to a fallback approach, though.
- There is a (currently open) feature request which allows Elevator blocks to be disguised as normal floor blocks. It is unknown if this will ever be implemented.
- The metadata for the various Elevator colors matches the exact order of the various vanilla dyes, but reversed.
- Colored Elevator blocks can be useful to create secret access rooms: using certain colors you can access certain floors of a building, while you can't with other ones.
