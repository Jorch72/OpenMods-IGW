[prefix{l}][prefix{1}]GOLDEN EGG [prefix{}] [prefix{}]

"[prefix{o}]Fix: golden egg leaving floating blocks when broken [prefix{}]"
- The Feature mentioned on OpenBlocks's changelog page (openmods.info).

The Golden Egg is a special block in OpenBlocks: it is the only block that can give birth to a new creature.
After some time after its placement, the egg hatches and a [link{openmods-igw:entity/OpenBlocks.MiniMe}]Mini Me [link{}] spawns.

[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
The Golden Egg goal is spawn a [link{openmods-igw:entity/OpenBlocks.MiniMe}]Mini Me [link{}], whose appearance resembles the one of the placer.

[prefix{2}]Placement [prefix{}]
To place the Golden Egg, use the "Use Item/Place Block" control (right-click, by default) while aiming at the block you want to place the egg on.
The Egg will be idle.

[prefix{2}]States [prefix{}]
The Golden Egg can be in one of seven states and can only switch from one to the next.
For the first four ones, the passage of state happens randomly.
The passage of state of the other ones is controlled by the block itself.
Every passage can be aborted by simply mining the block.

The seven states in order are: Inert, Slow Rotation, Medium Rotation, Fast Rotation, Floating, Falling and Exploding.

[prefix{2}]Idle [prefix{}]
When the Golden Egg is first placed it is idle, i.e. it does nothing apart from waiting in order to enter the pre-hatching phase.
The only state of the golden egg in this phase is Inert.

[prefix{2}]Pre-hatching [prefix{}]
After some time that the Golden Egg has been placed, the block enters the pre-hatching phase.
The amount of time needed to enter this phase is random.
During this phase the egg goes through the Slow Rotation, Medium Rotation and Fast Rotation states sequently.
The passage of state is, again, random.

During all three states, the egg will rotate around its axis with speed corresponding to the specific state.
More precisely, during the Slow Rotation, the egg will rotate slowly. Its speed will then increase during Medium Rotation and then reach its maximum during Fast Rotation.

[prefix{2}]Hatching [prefix{}]
The hatching phase starts after a random amount of time.
The only state the egg can assume during this phase is Floating.
During this period, the egg will start rising and, if enabled, will pick up some random blocks from the ground and float them as well.
For a list of all the blocks that can be picked up by the egg, refer to the [link{openmods-igw:item/openblocks.crane_magnet}]Crane Magnet [link{}]wiki page.
While floating in mid-air, the Golden Egg will also emit light cones spreading in all directions.

[prefix{2}]Post-hatching [prefix{}]
Following the hatching phase, the post-hatching phase begins as soon as the other finishes.
In this phase, the Golden Egg assumes the Falling and, subsequently, the Exploding state.

During the Falling state, the egg falls to the ground together with all the blocks that it picked up.
As soon as it touches the ground, the egg enters the Exploding state, where it explodes with a small-radius explosion and spawns a [link{openmods-igw:entity/OpenBlocks.MiniMe}]Mini Me [link{}].

When the Golden Egg explodes, the block is removed from the world and it isn't dropped as an item.

[prefix{l}]GUI [prefix{}]
This block has no GUI

[prefix{l}]Setup [prefix{}]
Place down the Golden Egg in an open space, not near any valuable buildings and/or structures, and then wait.
Be wary to exit the radius of the explosion, though.

[prefix{l}]Configuration options [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]"blocks" category [prefix{}]

Allows to enable (true) or disable (false) the Golden Egg.

[prefix{2}]"egg" category [prefix{}]
[prefix{5}]B:pickBlocks [prefix{}]
Controls if the egg should pick up blocks during the hatching phase. Enabling this option may lead to various in-game glitches.

[prefix{l}]Tutorials [prefix{}]
There are no tutorials for this block

[prefix{l}]Useful structures [prefix{}]
Actually, I guess it would be better to place it as away from any structure as possible...

[prefix{l}]Data values [prefix{}]
All Data Values from 0 to 15 represent the basic block.

[prefix{l}]History [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]1.2.0: [prefix{}]Golden Egg added.
[prefix{2}]1.2.9: [prefix{}]Fixed Golden Egg leaving some blocks floating when broken.
[prefix{2}]1.2.9: [prefix{}]Fixed random crash with Golden Egg placement.

[prefix{l}]Trivia [prefix{}]
- The Mini Me spawning doesn't happen until the block is removed from the world, i.e. in Post-hatching phase.
- The entire process can be aborted at any time by breaking the egg. This also applies to the floating egg.
- If, for whatever reason, the blocks don't fall back to the ground, you can simply punch them to turn them into falling blocks.
