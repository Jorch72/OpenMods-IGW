[prefix{l}][prefix{1}]BLOCK PLACER [prefix{}] [prefix{}]

"[prefix{o}]The [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.blockbreaker}]Block Breaker [link{}]and Block Placer are back! A perfect replacement for the now-dormant RedPower mod [prefix{}]"
- The feature mentioned in the README on OpenBlocks's GitHub page

The Block Placer, as the name says, places a block from its inventory in front of it when powered by [link{item/redstone}]redstone [link{}].

[prefix{l}]Info-Book description [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]
When given a [link{item/redstone}]redstone pulse [link{}]the block placer will place an item in the direction it's facing.

[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
The Block Placer, as the name implies, places a block from its internal inventory in front of it.
On every redstone input, the Block Placer will activate.
Differently from the [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.blockbreaker}]Block Breaker [link{}], it will activate once per redstone input.
In other words, if the input is not a pulse, like with a [link{block/lever}]Lever [link{}], the block placer will place a block just one time.
The input will have to be turned off and then on again to place another block.

Blocks placed by Block Placers still follow the same placement rules of the player.
E.g., [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.ropeladder}]Rope Ladders [link{}]will still unroll themselves to the ground, consuming one item per block placed (if enabled).

[prefix{l}]GUI [prefix{}]
[image{200, 795, openmods-igw:wiki/worldwide/images/block/blockPlacer/gui.png}]

























The Block Placer's GUI is very similar to the [link{block/dropper}]Dropper's [link{}]or [link{block/dispenser}]Dispenser's [link{}] ones.

The top part of the GUI is dominated by nine slots, placed on a 3 by 3 grid.
In here you can place the items you want the machine to place.
If more than one slot is occupied, then the block which will be placed will be chosen according to the following pattern:
[image{200, 1143, openmods-igw:/wiki/worldwide/images/block/blockPlacer/gui_choose_pattern_cropped.png}]









The bottom part of the GUI represents the player inventory.

[prefix{l}]Setup [prefix{}]
Place down a Block Placer, facing the direction you want to place the block, and then place down either a lever or a redstone clock.
Open the GUI and place in it the items you need to place down.
Activate the lever or the redstone clock.
Now the block placer should automatically place a block in front of him.

[prefix{l}]Configuration options [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]"blocks" category [prefix{}]
[prefix{5}]B:blockPlacer [prefix{}]
Allows to enable (true) or disable (false) the Block Placer.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] true

[prefix{l}]Tutorials [prefix{}]
There are no tutorials for this block.

[prefix{l}]Useful structures [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]Silk Touch fixer (Advanced version) [prefix{}]
This is a structure I built once because I had to mine some blocks ([link{block/oreRedstone}]Redstone Ores [link{}]), but I had only a Silk Touch pick.
In fact, this structure is mainly thought for people whose only [link{item/pickaxeWood}]Pickaxe [link{}] is enchanted with Silk Touch and they have to mine some ores.

[prefix{l}]Data values [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]0: [prefix{}] Block Placer (Down)
[prefix{o}]1: [prefix{}] Block Placer (Up)
[prefix{o}]2: [prefix{}] Block Placer (North)
[prefix{o}]3: [prefix{}] Block Placer (South)
[prefix{o}]4: [prefix{}] Block Placer (West)
[prefix{o}]5: [prefix{}] Block Placer (East)

Using data values from [prefix{o}]6 [prefix{}]to [prefix{o}]15 [prefix{}]will simply place the Block Placer with the default facing (down).

[prefix{l}]History [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]1.2.2: [prefix{}]Block Placer added.
[prefix{2}]1.2.5: [prefix{}]Fixed Block Placer using the whole stack instead of single items.
[prefix{2}]1.2.6: [prefix{}]Fixed Block Placer sometimes emptying inventories by themselves.

[prefix{l}]Trivia [prefix{}]
- Even if the block placer uses a fake player to place blocks, it still is unable to use items.

[prefix{o}]As you can see, an activated block breaker still keeps the original placing rules. [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]E.g., the [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.ropeladder}]Rope Ladders [link{}]have been placed following the "use all stack" rule anyway. [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]In the image you can also see a [link{openmods-igw:entity/OpenBlocks.Cartographer}]little Cartographer [link{}]. [prefix{}]
