[prefix{l}][prefix{1}]ROTATING ELEVATOR [prefix{}] [prefix{}]

"[prefix{o}]Colorable elevator blocks to quickly travel between floors. [prefix{}]"
- The feature mentioned in the README on OpenBlocks's GitHub page.

Rotating Elevators allow the player to move up or down various floors of a building in a quicker and easier way, rotating the player in the process.
Rotating Elevators can only interface with ones colored with the same [link{item/dyePowder.black}]dye [link{}].

[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
The Rotating Elevator can be used as an alternative and quicker way of travel between various floors of a building.

[prefix{2}]Elevating players [prefix{}]
In order to teleport players between floors, the two elevator blocks must be vertically on top of each other and have no "forbidden" blocks in between.
They also have to be of the same color, otherwise the research will fail.

Once all the initial conditions are met, the player can move up and down the various elevators by jumping or crouching, respectively, while on an elevator block.
The player will instantly be teleported to the upper or lower level of elevators and rotated towards the direction specified when placing the elevator.
If enabled in the configuration file, this will cost the player a certain amount of experience points, according to the distance of the two elevator blocks.
The destination elevator will also play a "teleportation sound".

The player can avoid teleportation while jumping or sneaking by starting the jump or crouch action before stepping on the elevator block.
In this case the elevator will act as a normal block.

When multiple elevator blocks are used in conjuction (such as in a 2x2 square pattern), the elevator can try to center the player in the middle of the shape.
This behaviour is configurable and disabled by default.

[prefix{2}]Rotating players [prefix{}]
When elevating players, Rotating Elevators also rotate the player towards the direction specified when placing the block.
The direction can be identified thanks to the arrows on top of the elevator blocks.
When the player teleports between the various elevators, its rotation will be set according to the arrows.
In other words, the player is going to look where the top-most arrow is pointing.

[prefix{2}]Dying [prefix{}]
Rotating Elevator blocks can be dyed in order to distinguish them from other elevator blocks above or below.
To dye a Rotating Elevator block, right-click it with a [link{item/dyePowder.black}]dye (e.g. an ink sack) [link{}].
The Rotating Elevator block will be dyed, but the dye will not be consumed in the process.

When the elevator block is broken, the given item will have the same block color.
When placed back, the elevator will keep the previous color, differently from its [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.elevator}]"normal" counterpart [link{}].

[prefix{l}]GUI [prefix{}]
This block has no GUI

[prefix{l}]Setup [prefix{}]
Place down at least a pair of elevator blocks within the maximum distance (configurable), rotated according to preference.
Make sure there is room for a player to fit in in both spots.
If needed, dye the pair of elevators.
Then simply either jump or sneak to go up or down, according to your desire.

[prefix{l}]Configuration options [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]"blocks" category [prefix{}]
[prefix{5}]B:elevator_rotating [prefix{}]
Allows to enable (true) or disable (false) the Rotating Elevator.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] true
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@block@elevator_rotating}]

[prefix{2}]"dropblock" category [prefix{}]
[prefix{5}]B:centerOnBlock [prefix{}]
Specifies if the player should be centered (true) or not (false) when teleported between elevators.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] false
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorCenter}]
[prefix{5}]D:elevatorXpDrainRatio [prefix{}]
Specifies the ratio of XP that is consumed everytime an elevator is used.
The formula used to calculate the total XP consumed is [prefix{o}]total = distance * ratio [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] 0.0
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorXpDrainRatio}]
[prefix{5}]B:ignoreAllBlocks [prefix{}]
If enabled (true), the elevator doesn't search for blocks in-between the starting point and the ending one.
Setting this value to true is the same as using a positive infinity value for [prefix{o}]maxPassThrough [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] false
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorIgnoreBlocks}]
[prefix{5}]B:ignoreHalfBlocks [prefix{}]
If enabled (true), the elevator won't consider half blocks (e.g. [link{block/stoneSlab.stone}]Slabs [link{}]) when counting the amount of blocks it can pass through.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] false
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorIgnoreHalfBlocks}]
[prefix{5}]B:irregularBlocksArePassable [prefix{}]
If enabled (true), the elevator will attempt to pass through blocks which have custom collision boxes, or, in other words, are not a full block.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] true
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@irregularBlocksArePassable}]
[prefix{5}]I:maxPassThrough [prefix{}]
Specifies the amount of blocks the elevator can pass through before the teleportation fails.
The value is considered as the maximum bound and, as such, excluded from the check.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] 4
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorMaxBlockPassCount}]
[prefix{5}]I:searchDistance [prefix{}]
Specifies the maximum distance there can be between two elevator blocks before the teleportation fails.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] 20
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorTravelDistance}]
[prefix{5}]S:specialBlockRules [prefix{}]
Specifies custom rules for specific blocks which have to be respected by elevators.
The rules must be written in the format [prefix{o}]<modId>:<blockName>:<action> [prefix{}] or [prefix{o}]id:<blockId>:<action> [prefix{}]
The valid actions are [prefix{o}]abort [prefix{}](the elevator will abort the teleportation process), [prefix{o}]increment [prefix{}](the block is counted in the limit) and [prefix{o}]ignore [prefix{}] (the block is ignored completely).
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] 
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@config@elevatorRules}]

[prefix{l}]Trivia [prefix{}]
- By default, the Rotating Elevator uses a custom packet to check if the player is jumping. In case Player API is installed, the detection is reverted to a fallback approach, though.
- Strangely enough, the Rotating Elevator stores the current rotation in the metadata instead of the colour, which is stored in the Tile Entity instead.
- Colored Rotating Elevator blocks can be useful to create secret access rooms: using certain colors you can access certain floors of a building, while you can't with other ones.
