[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
The Bear Trap can be used to block all mobs, either peaceful or hostile.

[prefix{2}]Mob trapping [prefix{}]
Place a Bear Trap down and then wait for a mob to walk over it.
They will be trapped until they despawn or you kill them.
Hostile mobs can still deal damage to the various entities, though.

[prefix{l}]GUI [prefix{}]
This block has no GUI.

[prefix{l}]Setup [prefix{}]
Place it down and then wait for mobs to walk over it.

[prefix{l}]Configuration options [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]"blocks" category [prefix{}]

[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] true

[prefix{l}]Useful structures [prefix{}]
The following list is made of unofficial structures.

[prefix{2}]Mob Spawner protection system [prefix{}]
This is a structure that I, TheSilkMiner, used in my Agrarian Skies let's play.
It serves as a protection against mobs who are able to evade the first barrier of pistons during its closing (opened in the image) and avoid them to wander away on the island.
The design can also provide a second barrier of pistons to avoid that mobs that are not trapped in the bear traps (it can happen) can leave the mob spawner.

As you can see in the image, the setup is extremely simple: two bear traps positioned in between two one-block barriers which can be raised and a two-high ceiling.
The two barriers can be raised using the buttons, which are connected to a Flick-Flock [link{item/redstone}]redstone [link{}]circuit.

[prefix{2}]Trading system [prefix{}]
Another neat "structure" I use.
It is simply a way to trap [link{entity/Villager}]Villagers [link{}] and use them for trades.
[image{200, 1246, openmods-igw:wiki/worldwide/images/block/openblocks/beartrap/structures_trading_survival.png}]














The setup is extremely simple: place some bear traps all around the house and then lure some villagers from a nearby village until they get trapped in one of the bear traps.
Now you can use them for trades.

[prefix{l}]Data values [prefix{}]

[prefix{o}]1: [prefix{}] Bear Trap (East/West)
[prefix{o}]2: [prefix{}] Bear Trap (South/North)

The data values from [prefix{o}]4 [prefix{}]to [prefix{o}]15 [prefix{}]are simply repetitions of the first four, so they are not listed here.
