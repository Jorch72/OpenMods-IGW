[prefix{l}][prefix{1}]BLOCK BREAKER [prefix{}] [prefix{}]

"[prefix{o}]The Block Breaker and [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.blockPlacer}]Block Placer [link{}]are back! A perfect replacement for the now-dormant RedPower mod [prefix{}]"
- The feature mentioned in the README on OpenBlocks's GitHub page

The Block Breaker, as the name says, breaks the block in front of him when powered by [link{item/redstone}]redstone [link{}].

[prefix{l}]Info-Book description [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]
When given a [link{item/redstone}]redstone pulse [link{}]the block breaker will break the block it's facing.

[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
The Block Breaker, as the name says, breaks the block in front of it.

[prefix{2}]Block breaking[prefix{}]
Everytime it receives a redstone current, the block breaker will activate for half a second.
If the input is not a pulse, like with a [link{block/lever}]Lever [link{}], then the Block Breaker will reactivate only when updated.
The maximum harvest level of a Block Breaker corresponds to the [link{item/pickaxeDiamond}]Diamond Pickaxe [link{}] harvest level.

When breaking a block, the front texture of the Block Breaker changes to an activated state.

The Block Breaker then outputs the broken block from the back side, where you can also connect pipes from other mods, e.g. BuildCraft.

[prefix{l}]GUI [prefix{}]
This block has no GUI.

[prefix{l}]Setup [prefix{}]
Place down a Block Breaker, facing the block you want to break, and then place down either a lever or a redstone clock.
Activate the lever or the redstone clock.
Now the block breaker should automatically start breaking the block in front of him.

[prefix{l}]Configuration options [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]"blocks" category [prefix{}]
[prefix{5}]B:blockbreaker [prefix{}]
Allows to enable (true) or disable (false) the Block Breaker.
[prefix{o}]Default value: [prefix{}] true
[prefix{o}]Current value: [prefix{}] [variable{@var@OpenBlocks@block@blockbreaker}]

[prefix{l}]Useful structures [prefix{}]
The following list is made of unofficial structures.

[prefix{2}]Automated [link{block/cobblestone}]Cobblestone [link{}]farm [prefix{}]
An unofficial structure, useful for quick mining.
As you can see in the following image, the structure is really simple, but requires a lot of resources, so it is mostly a mid-game structure.
But cobblestone is never enough...

The pulse circuit, used to power the [link{block/pistonBase}]Piston [link{}] just for one redstone tick is here constructed with a [link{block/pistonStickyBase}]Sticky Piston [link{}] and another block.
You can also use a normal piston and a gravity-subjected block, like [link{block/sand.default}]Sand [link{}] or [link{block/gravel}]Gravel [link{}].

[prefix{2}]Silk Touch fixer (Advanced version) [prefix{}]
This is a structure I built once because I had to mine some blocks ([link{block/oreRedstone}]Redstone Ores [link{}]), but I had only a Silk Touch pick.
In fact, this structure is mainly thought for people whose only [link{item/pickaxeWood}]Pickaxe [link{}] is enchanted with Silk Touch and they have to mine some ores.

This structure can also be simplified, by removing the whole [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.blockPlacer}]Block Placer [link{}] and [link{openmods-igw:block/openblocks.vacuumhopper}]Vacuum Hopper [link{}]parts.
In the advanced type the Block Breaker is powered by a [link{block/lever}]Lever [link{}] and acts as a BUD switch.

[prefix{l}]Data values [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]0: [prefix{}] Block Breaker (Down)
[prefix{o}]1: [prefix{}] Block Breaker (Up)
[prefix{o}]2: [prefix{}] Block Breaker (North)
[prefix{o}]3: [prefix{}] Block Breaker (South)
[prefix{o}]4: [prefix{}] Block Breaker (West)
[prefix{o}]5: [prefix{}] Block Breaker (East)

Using data values from [prefix{o}]6 [prefix{}]to [prefix{o}]15 [prefix{}]will simply place the Block Breaker with the default facing (down).

[prefix{l}]History [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]1.2.2: [prefix{}]Block Breaker added.
[prefix{2}]1.2.6: [prefix{}]Fixed Block Placer sometimes emptying inventories by themselves.
[prefix{2}]1.2.9: [prefix{}]Fixed Block Breaker sometimes ignoring restrictions.
[prefix{2}]1.3.0: [prefix{}]Fixed Block Breaker not dropping results.
[prefix{2}]1.4.2: [prefix{}]Fixed Block Breaker not pushing to BuildCraft pipes.
[prefix{2}]1.4.3: [prefix{}]Changed Block Breaker timing to prevent item duplication.

[prefix{l}]Trivia [prefix{}]
- The Block Breaker is an extremely good example of a BUD switch: see as an example the Silk Touch fixer structure.
- Differently from other blocks, the Block Breaker doesn't store the activated state in a data value, but as a boolean value in its Block Entity.
