[prefix{l}][prefix{1}]FAN [prefix{}] [prefix{}]

"[prefix{o}]Fans -- the power of an industrial fan in the size of a desk fan [prefix{}]"
- The feature mentioned in the README on OpenBlocks's GitHub page.

Fans are redstone-activated blocks which blow entities away from the direction they are facing.

[prefix{l}]Info-Book description [prefix{}]

The fan will blow players, mobs or entities in the direction it's facing.

[prefix{2}]Spontaneous drop [prefix{}]
The Fan will also spontaneously drop itself if water or lava flows into its space or a piston tries to push or moves a block into its space.
Be wary, though, that lava destroys the drop instantaneously.

Differently from buttons, the fan doesn't drop if the block it is attached to is removed.
It is currently unknown if this is a bug or a design decision.

[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
The Fan can be used as a way to push away entities, such as mobs or other players.

[prefix{2}]Placement [prefix{}]
To place the Fan, use the "Use Item/Place Block" control (right-click, by default) while aiming at the top of the block you want to place the fan on.
A fan can be attached only to the top of any solid or transparent block, provided their top side is considered solid.
When placed, the fan will always face the player who placed it.

[prefix{2}]Activation [prefix{}]
The Fan, when placed, is in an inactive state, but can be activated by players.
To activate a placed fan, provide redstone power to the block itself or one of the nearby blocks using a power source such as [link{item/redstone}]redstone dust [link{}] or [link{block/lever}]a lever [link{}].

It can also be configured to be always active, though.

[prefix{2}]Behavior [prefix{}]
When the fan is activated, it will immediately push all entities away from it in the direction it is facing, provided they are in a spherical cone area in front of the fan.
It is not necessary to have a clear line of sight: the fan can push even through full blocks.

All the entities in the fan range (configurable) are affected by the fan, with a force directly proportional to the distance between the entity and the fan itself and the amount of power provided to the fan.
Creative mode players are excluded by the "pushable" entities, mainly to allow server owners to shut down problematic fan walls.

Every fan acts on every entity indipendently form all the others.
This means that every entity is subjected to the force of every in-range fan, without exceptions.
If one fan doesn't apply a lot of force by itself (e.g. a player walking speed is unaffected), a wall of fans can quickly become a real obstacle to overcome.

This block has no GUI

[prefix{l}]Setup [prefix{}]
Place down one or more fans in the direction you want them to push entities.
Then provide a redstone current and watch all the entities being pushed away

[prefix{l}]Useful structures [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]Mob Spawner 0.1 [prefix{}]
[image{200, 1515, openmods-igw:wiki/worldwide/images/block/fan/structures_mob_spawner_untested_brightened.png}]















This structure, which I call "Mob Spawner 0.1", can be considered an alternative to a traditional mob spawner.
The various mobs, in the image represented by [link{entity/Villager}]Villagers [link{}], are forced by various fans on a water stream.
The water stream then takes the various mobs and brings them to the sides, allowing the player to easily kill them.

This setup has not been completely tested in all edge cases, hence the "0.1" diciture.
Its functionality is not completely guaranteed, but it should work in the 90% of cases (as of 01/06/2017 on my machine).

The image above has also been brightened, for ease of use.

[prefix{l}]Data values [prefix{}]
All Data Values from 0 to 15 represent the basic block.

[prefix{l}]History [prefix{}]
[prefix{2}]1.2.0: [prefix{}]Fan added.
[prefix{2}]1.2.6: [prefix{}]Fan strength can now be controlled by redstone.
[prefix{2}]1.3.0: [prefix{}]Fixed Fan not working with more redstone cables.

[prefix{l}]Trivia [prefix{}]
- Even if the Fan requires a block to be placed on, it does not drop if the block under it is removed, much like beds. It is unknown if this is a bug or a feature.
- One fan powered directly by a redstone block generates enough force to push a still player away, but when the player is walking or sprinting, the effect is almost noticeable.
