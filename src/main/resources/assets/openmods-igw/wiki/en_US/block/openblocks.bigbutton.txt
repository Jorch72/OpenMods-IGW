[prefix{l}][prefix{1}]BIG BUTTON [prefix{}] [prefix{}]

"[prefix{o}]The Redstone Configurable Pulse Lightweight Mega Touch Sensor, also known as the BIG BUTTON [prefix{}]"
- The feature mentioned in the README on OpenBlocks's GitHub page

The Big Button is a larger version than [link{block/button}]its vanilla counterpart [link{}].
The length of its pulse can be configured thanks to the built-in GUI.

[prefix{l}]Info-Book description [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]
The big button is a large [link{block/button}]button [link{}]that can be placed on walls.
If you shift-click on the button with an empty hand it will bring up an inventory with a single slot.
You can put items into this slot to increase the length of time the button is pressed - one item increases the button press by one tick.

[prefix{2}]Spontaneous drop [prefix{}]
The Big Button will also spontaneously drop itself if the block it is attached to is removed, if water or lava flows into its space or a piston tries to push or moves a block into its space.
Be wary, though, that lava destroys the drop instantaneously.

[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
A button can be used as a monostable power source (it will automatically deactivate shortly after being activated).

[prefix{2}]Placement [prefix{}]
To place the Big Button, use the "Use Item/Place Block" control (right-click, by default) while aiming at the surface to which it should be attached.
A button can be attached only to the side of any full solid opaque block.

[prefix{2}]Activation [prefix{}]
The Big Button is usually in an inactive state, but can be temporarily activated by players.
To activate a placed button, use the "Use Item/Place Block" control (right-click, by default).

[prefix{2}]Behavior [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]See also: Configuration [prefix{}]
[prefix{o}]See also: GUI [prefix{}]
When activated, the Big Button will stay active for as many ticks as the items placed in its configuration slot.
The minimum amount of time it will stay activated is always 1 redstone tick (2 game ticks or 1/10 of a second).
While active, the button:
- powers any adjacent [link{item/redstone}]redstone dust [link{}]to power level 15, including beneath the button;
- powers any adjacent [link{item/comparator}]redstone comparators [link{}]or [link{item/diode}]redstone repeaters [link{}]facing away from the button to power level 15;
- strongly powers its attachment block to power level 15;
- activates any adjacent mechanism components, including above or below, such as [link{block/pistonBase}]pistons [link{}], [link{block/redstoneLight}]redstone lamps [link{}], etc.
When a button changes state it will provide a redstone update to all redstone components adjacent to itself (including above and below), and to all redstone components adjacent to its attachment block. 

[prefix{2}]Configuration [prefix{}]
To configurate the amount of time this block will stay powered, use the "Use Item/Place Block" control (right-click, by default) while crouching (shift, by default).
In the opened GUI, place a stack of item corresponding to the amount of redstone ticks the button should stay pressed.
E.g. to replicate a stone button, you would need to place 10 items.

[prefix{l}]GUI [prefix{}]
[image{200, 1242, openmods-igw:wiki/worldwide/images/block/bigbutton/gui.png}]






















On the top of the GUI you can find a single slot.
In there you can place up to a stack of items to determine the length of a redstone pulse.
In other words, this will determine how many redstone ticks the button will stay activated.

The bottom part of the GUI is simply the player inventory.

[prefix{l}]Setup [prefix{}]
Place the button on the desired surface.
If you want to configure the amount of ticks the button should stay pressed, shift-right-click the button with an empty hand and place a stack of item in the slot.
One item equals one redstone tick.

For reference, a stone button stays powered for 10 redstone ticks (1 second) while a wooden one for 15 redstone ticks (1.5 seconds).

[prefix{l}]Useful structures [prefix{}]
The following list is made of unofficial structures.

[prefix{2}]Cheaper T Flip-Flop circuit [prefix{}]
This structure is simply another way to make a T Flip-Flop circuit.
As you can see in the image, the structure is really simple: a [link{block/pistonStickyBase}]sticky piston [link{}]facing a solid block connected via another block to a Big Button.
Under the block the piston is facing, there is a simple [link{block/notGate}]redstone torch [link{}].
The output line starts from the block just above the torch and goes all the way to where you want it to be.

[prefix{l}]Trivia [prefix{}]
- If there isn't any item in the slot, the block will stay activated for one tick anyway.
- Differently from the [link{block/button}]normal button [link{}], you cannot walk through the Big Button
