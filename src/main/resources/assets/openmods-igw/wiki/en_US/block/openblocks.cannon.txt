[prefix{l}]Usage [prefix{}]
The Item Cannon can be used to launch items from a nearby inventory to a location determined by the user.

Its usage is really simple: place it down near an inventory (could be a [link{block/chest}]Chest [link{}], a [link{block/dispenser}]Dispenser [link{}]...), then power them.
It will immediately start shooting towards the default direction (south, pitch of 0).

To aim the cannon you can use a [link{item/openblocks.pointer}]Pointer [link{}] (more information on its wiki page).

When shooting, the cannon will emit a sound and will recoil for a moment, before shooting once again or stopping in case no other item is present in the nearby inventories.

[prefix{l}]Setup [prefix{}]
