# Translation notes

Before proposing a translation for the wiki, please make sure that the positioning of the images and of the other graphical elements
is correct by checking it in-game.

If it isn't, then change **only** the numerical values in the commands (the parts between square brackets).

Also, do not delete any blank space which is after an _image_ or _crafting_ command: they are already set to provide enough space for
the image to fit without any problems.

Make sure to use the images that are already provided in the `worldwide` directory. This also applies to GUIs, so don't try to cheat.
If you need to add an image to better explain a concept, then feel free to do so in the `worldwide` directory, using the conventions.
For no reasons anything other than plain text files, `.txt` that is, should be present in locale-specific directories.
